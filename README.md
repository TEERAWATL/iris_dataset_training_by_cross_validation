# iris_dataset_training_by_cross_validation


## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on four different attributes - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The Iris dataset, a popular dataset in the field of machine learning, is used for this purpose.

The machine learning model used in this project is Logistic Regression, a simple yet powerful algorithm suitable for multi-class classification problems. The model's performance is evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, a technique that provides a robust estimate of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.


The code for this project is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning. The steps involved are as follows:

Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn's built-in function.
Define a pipeline that first standardizes the data (to have zero mean and unit variance) and then applies the Logistic Regression algorithm.
Perform k-fold cross-validation (k=10 in this case) to evaluate the model's performance. The accuracies for each fold, as well as the average accuracy, are displayed.
Train the Logistic Regression model on the entire dataset.
Define a utility function, utilize_model, that takes new data and the trained model as input and returns the predicted class for the new data.
